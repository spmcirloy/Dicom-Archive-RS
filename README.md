# Dicom-Archive-RS
To Generate an external dicom archive structure for RS using a conquest server

The hope is to use python to query first the interal database to find a pt. if pt. is not found then query an external dicom server to see if the pt is there, if so ask for a push and import the data.  If not return pt not found.
